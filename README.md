A text-based adventure game developed in C. Players navigate through a maze, collect resources, craft items, and battle monsters. Features include random maze generation, item interactions, and combat mechanics.

Language: C

2. Labyrinth-Scala
An enhanced version of the Labyrinth game built using Scala. This version leverages Scala's functional programming capabilities to offer a more flexible and scalable game architecture while maintaining engaging gameplay mechanics.

Language: Scala

3. Predicting Invariant Mass of Dielectron Events
A research project focused on predicting the invariant mass of dielectron events in particle physics. Utilizes statistical analysis and simulation tools to analyze particle collision data and forecast outcomes.

Language: Python

4. Database Project
A comprehensive database project divided into two parts:

Part 1: Designing a database using UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to outline the system architecture and relationships.
Part 2: Writing complex SQL queries for database manipulation, data retrieval, and ensuring data integrity.
Language: SQL, UML (Documentation in Finnish)

5. Modeling land uplift using STAR
This project models land uplift in post-glacial areas using a STAR model. It compares the STAR model with simpler models and examines their effectiveness in capturing land uplift dynamics based on historical sea level data from Stockholm.

Language: R


7. Sähkönkulutuksen Ennustaminen SARIMAX-mallilla
Applies the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous factors) model to forecast electricity consumption. This project analyzes time series data alongside external factors to provide accurate consumption predictions.

Language: R
