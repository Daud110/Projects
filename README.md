# Projects

1. Labyrinth-C
A text-based adventure game developed in C. Players navigate through a maze, collect resources, craft items, and battle monsters. Features include random maze generation, item interactions, and combat mechanics.

2. Labyrinth-Scala
An enhanced version of the Labyrinth game built using Scala. This version leverages Scala's functional programming capabilities to offer a more flexible and scalable game architecture while maintaining engaging gameplay mechanics.

Language: Scala and C

Key Features:
Maze navigation
Item collection and crafting
Combat system


3. Predicting Invariant Mass of Dielectron Events
a machine learning project focused on predicting the invariant mass of dielectron events in particle physics. Utilizes statistical analysis and simulation tools to analyze particle collision data and forecast outcomes.


Technologies Used:
Machine Learning tools Sklearn, pandas and matplotlib

Files: Predicting Invariant Mass of Dielectron Events_final1.pdf: The final report detailing the analysis and findings.

4. Database Project
A comprehensive database project divided into two parts:

Part 1: Designing a database using UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to outline the system architecture and relationships.
Part 2: Writing complex SQL queries for database manipulation, data retrieval, and ensuring data integrity.
Language: SQL, UML (Documentation in Finnish)


Technologies Used:
Database: SQL

Key Features:
Database design
UML modeling
SQL query development

Files:
DatabaseProject1.pdf: Report containing UML diagrams.
Database Project2.rar: Archive containing SQL queries.

5. Modeling land uplift using STAR
This project models land uplift in post-glacial areas using a STAR model. It compares the STAR model with simpler models and examines their effectiveness in capturing land uplift dynamics based on historical sea level data from Stockholm.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: R


Key Features:
Time series analysis
STAR model implementation


Files:
Maannousun_mallinnus_kandi.pdf: Report detailing the modeling approach and findings.
modelling land uplift using STAR model.r: R script implementing the STAR model.


7. Sähkönkulutuksen Ennustaminen SARIMAX-mallilla
Applies the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous factors) model to forecast electricity consumption. This project analyzes time series data alongside external factors to provide accurate consumption predictions.


Technologies Used:
Programming Language: R

Key Features:
Time series forecasting
SARIMAX model implementation

Files:
Loppuraportti_sähkökulutuksen ennustaminen(1).pdf: Final report detailing the forecasting approach and results.
sähkönkulutuksen ennustaminen SARIMAX .R: R script implementing the SARIMAX model.


8. Bayesian Analysis Project
Description:
This project applies Bayesian Data Analysis to investigate the impact of various medical factors on newborn mortality, with a specific focus on gender differences. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we analyze whether factors like birth weight, platelet count, pneumonia, and IVH affect mortality differently for male and female infants.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: R

Key Features:
Bayesian statistical analysis

Files:
Bayes_project.pdf: Report detailing the Bayesian analysis.
bayesfinalproject.R: R script containing the analysis code.
